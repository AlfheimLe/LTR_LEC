Large-Scale Trust-Region Methods For Linear Equality Constrained Optimization

MATLAB codes

This project contains the implementations of the Algorithms from the article
"Large-Scale Quasi-Newton Trust-Region Methods With Low Dimensional Linear-
Equality Constraints", J.J. Brust, R.F. Marcia, C.G. Petra, 2018.

Four folders are contained in this project:

main 	- Implementations of Algorithm 1, and Algorithm 2,</br>
netlib 	- Problems from netlib (.mps) format, and routine to read mps into
		MATLAB, </br>
solvers - External Algorithms for comparisons, </br>
tests 	- Numerical experiments, including auxiliary files. Run an experiment
		from this folder to test the methods.
